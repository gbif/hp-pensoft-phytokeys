This is Ð° GBIF Hosted Portal, displaying data extracted or associated with articles published in [PhytoKeys](https://phytokeys.pensoft.net/).

**PhytoKeys** is a peer-reviewed, open-access, rapidly disseminated journal launched to accelerate research and free information exchange in taxonomy, phylogeny, biogeography and evolution of plants.

**PhytoKeys** aims to apply the latest trends and methodologies in publishing and preservation of digital materials to meet the highest possible standards of the cybertaxonomy era.

**PhytoKeys** will publish papers in systematic botany containing taxonomic/floristic data on any taxon of any geological age from any part of the world with no limit to manuscript size.

**PhytoKeys** will consider for publishing works on the following topics:

* descriptions of new taxa, if they are accompanied with proper diagnoses, keys and/or distinction from close relatives or similar taxa
* taxonomic revisions of extant (or ''recent'') and fossil plant groups
* checklists and catalogues
* phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses
* papers in descriptive and/or historical biogeography
* methodology papers
* data mining and literature surveys
* monographs, conspecti, atlases
* collections of papers, Festschrift volumes, conference proceedings

Extensive floristic overviews on a group in a country or larger region are welcome. Short floristic contributions may be considered if they are based on significant or unexpected discovery. Regular floristic contributions may eventually be published in special issues devoted to a region/country.

The following categories of papers will be considered:

* original research articles
* reviews - longer articles, offering a comprehensive overview, historical analysis or/and future perspectives of a topic
* monographs and collections of papers with no limit in size, published as 'special issues'
* data papers
* short communications
* letters and discussion papers
* book reviews

The journal publishes electronic versions of the articles when these are ready to publish, without delays that might be caused by completion of an issue. These electronic versions are not "pre-prints" but final and immutable (Version of Record), hence available for the purposes of biological nomenclature. The date indicated on the electronic version is to be considered the actual publication date.

ISBN numbers will be assigned to large monographic papers (i.e., major revisions of taxa, min 100 pp), collections of papers, Festschrift volumes, atlases, checklists, conspecti.
